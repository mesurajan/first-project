##Infrastructure Monitoring and Response Portal

This project aims to develop a web portal that allows citizens to monitor the state of public infrastructure projects and request urgent repairs when needed, akin to calling for an "infrastructure ambulance." The portal will display real-time data on ongoing construction and maintenance projects, providing transparency into costs, timelines, and progress. Citizens can report potholes, collapsed bridges, or other infrastructure failures through the portal and track the response. The system will prioritize and route these repair requests to the appropriate municipal departments to dispatch infrastructure ambulances - repair crews ready for rapid deployment.By leveraging technology to coordinate rapid response to infrastructure failures, this project can help municipalities improve safety, accountability, and responsiveness in public works. The goal is to build smarter, user-centered tools to maintain the most critical components of cities' physical assets.
